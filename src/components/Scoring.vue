            <p>All the players who guessed the right answer can move their main pawn forwards 1 tile. If the player picked a Level 2 card and guessed the right answer, he moves forwards 2 tiles. 

All the players who didn’t guess the right answer stay in their tile. If the player picked a Level 2 card and didn’t guess the right answer, he moves backward 1 tile. 

If a player knows the name of the artist, the piece of art, or both, they can say it and will chose one opponent to move backward 1 tile. If mutiple players have one of these answers, this power goes to the first one to say it. 

The player removes the card and the player on his left chooses the next card. </p>
