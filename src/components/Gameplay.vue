            <p>The youngest player chooses a card from the pile he wants. He places it on the board in the card location. Every player will now have to guess the art movement of the art piece on the card. Each player places their answer pawn in the hole of this art movement without showing it to the others. 

When everybody is ready, the player that chose the card flips it and reveals the answer.  </p>
